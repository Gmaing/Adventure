      /* Now you will utilize pre-written methods from the
         'Quest Framework' to design your own adventure game */


      /* These methods will be "called" by your character object reference.

         For example, to add a scenario in the game to visit a merchant, type:

            myChar.merchant();

         The game is meant to be assembled using simple action methods and depending on how you
         implement them and in what order, you have endless possibilities to create your own unique storyline.
